    <h2>Welcome to Vafor IT</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Maxwell, a full-stack developer from Utah. With a basis in JavaScript, I'm passionate about crafting innovative web applications. This website is a platform to showcase my skills and alleviate boredom in school.</p>
    <p>I've also got a project hosted on GitHub, which is open-source and available for anyone to contribute to. Feel free to check it out and explore the codeâ€”whether you're a fellow developer or just curious about my work!</p>
    <p>You can find the project here: <a href="https://github.com/v4for/v4for.github.io" target="_blank">Vafor IT GitHub</a></p>
